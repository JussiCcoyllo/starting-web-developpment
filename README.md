Tim Berners-Lee
=======
*by Jussi Ccoyllo*

This is an exercice so complet because we have used many propertys in HTML and CSS. Our coachs asked us to create the page with the precises instructions (fonts, colors, layout, images, etc) about Tim Berners-Lee.

## Main elements used :
**HTML**
+ HTML Grouping Tags
+ HTML Block and Inline Elements

**CSS**
+ Grid, flex-box 
+ Responsive Design

## Dificulties
+ Layout with Grid
+ Apply the same font in the child class
+ Responsive Design

## Achievements
+ I identify the properties to use in html and css more quickly
+ I'm able to define a good layout structure for future sites to create.
